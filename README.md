### ToDo list âœ…

1. **Introduction:**
    - [ ] Understand the requirements of a flexible image gallery.

2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**
    - [ ] **Task 1:** Create the HTML structure.
        - Add a `<section>` container with a class of `gallery`.
        - Add at least six `<img>` elements. Images have been provided in the `assets/images` folder.
    - [ ] **Task 2:** Style the image gallery using flexbox.
        - Set `display: flex;` on the `gallery` class.
        - Use `flex-wrap` to wrap the images onto multiple lines.
        - Use `justify-content` to space the images evenly.
        - Use `align-items` to center the images vertically.
    - [ ] **Task 3:** Style the images.
        - Set a fixed width and height for the images to ensure they are the same size. Starting with something like this can let you specify only images in the gallery:
        ```css 
        .gallery img {
            width: /* set a value that you feel looks good */;
            height: /* set a value that you feel looks good */;
        }
        ```
        - Use the `object-fit` property with the value `cover` to ensure the images look great at the specified size.
        - **Note:** This is a common technique for making galleries look great with minimal code. 


3. **Review:**
    - [ ] View the updated work, ensure all changes are applied correctly, and discuss further improvements.
