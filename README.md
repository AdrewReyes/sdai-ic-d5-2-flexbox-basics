## Together - Building a Responsive Navigation Menu and Footer ü§ù
**Description:**
In this collaborative exercise, students will work with the instructor to build a responsive navigation menu and footer using flexbox. Images have been modified with image editing software to be appropriately sized for this website and display better at multiple sizes.

## Solo - Creating a Flexible Image Gallery üí™
**Description:**
Students will independently create a flexible image gallery that adapts to different screen sizes using flexbox.

### Prepare Your Workspace
1. [ ] First, stop any other Codespaces you have running to conserve core hours.

## Forking Repositories
When you fork a repo, there is a box checked by default to only copy the main branch. You will want to uncheck this box so that you get all the branches you need. 

If you forget to uncheck that box, you can still get access to the other branches you need. You'll need to follow the instructions from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch), taking special note of step 5 when you reach it.

## Branch Management
These activities use several branches. After watching your instructor's initial demo, you'll need to use two branches in order. 

First, you'll need to use the `together` branch to try an activity alongside your instructor. This may be very similar to the demo you saw, but you'll get to practice these skills, too.
Next, you'll use the `solo` branch to push yourself and learn more. Getting hands on like this teaches you a lot, but you can still ask your AI and your instructor for help.

You can switch branches by using this command:

`git checkout branch-name`

Examples:

```
git checkout together
```

```
git checkout solo
```

### ToDo list ‚úÖ
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

1. **Introduction:**
    - [ ] Discuss the key elements of a responsive navigation menu.

2. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough:**
    - [ ] **Task 1:** Create the HTML structure.
        - Add a `<nav>` element with a class of `menu`.
        - Add several `<a>` elements for each menu item and point them to the appropriate ID on the page, like this: `<a href="#about">About</a>`.
    - [ ] **Task 2:** Style the navigation menu using flexbox.
        - Set `display: flex;` on the `menu` class.
        - Use `justify-content` to space the items evenly.
        - Use `align-items` to center the items vertically.
    - [ ] **Task 3:** Style the footer.
        - Style the footer using flexbox properties to ensure it is responsive.

3. **Review:**
    - [ ] Review the completed navigation menu and footer together, ensuring all changes are applied correctly and discuss further improvements.
